# Food-Prices-Forecast-Using-ARIMANigeria’s Food Price Story in One Chart (1992–2040)
I just ran an ARIMA forecast on Nigeria’s Food Price Ratio (Food CPI ÷ Overall CPI) — and the results are both fascinating and sobering.
📊 Historical rollercoaster:

1999: Ratio hit 0.82 → SAP-era hunger; food was unaffordable gold.
2004: Crashed to 0.22 → Oil-boom plenty; ₦5k fed a family for days.
2016: Climbed to ~0.62 → Recession + tomato Ebola.
2025: Plunged to all-time low 0.12 — but don’t celebrate.

🚨 2025–2040 Forecast: The model predicts the ratio stays flat at ~0.10–0.12 for the next 15 years.
Translation: Food will feel “cheap” only because transport, rent, fuel, and school fees will rise even faster. A bag of rice may hit ₦500k by 2035, yet still be “just 12% of the budget.” We’ve seen this movie before — Zimbabwe, Venezuela.
💡 Key takeaway for economists, policymakers & agribusiness leaders:
Stop tracking the ratio. Track absolute naira prices of rice, yam, beans, and garri. That’s what determines if a family eats twice or once a day.
Nigeria went from “food was so cheap we wasted it” (1970s) to “food is now gold” (2025). The charts don’t lie — we’re back to 1980s hardship, just wearing a different mask.
